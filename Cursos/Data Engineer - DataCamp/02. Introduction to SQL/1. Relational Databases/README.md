## Tables

### A seat at the table

- Fields are set at database creation; there is no limit to the number of records

### Good table manners

Table names should...

- be lowercase
- have no spaces - use underscores instead
- refer to a collective group or be plural

### Laying the table: records

A record is a row that holds on an individual observation

### Laying the table: fields

A field is a column that holds one piece of information about all records

### More table manners

Field names should...

- be lowercase
- have no spaces
- be singular
- be different from other field names
- be different from the table name

### Assigned seats

- _Unique identifiers_ are used to identify records in a table
- They are unique and often numbers
