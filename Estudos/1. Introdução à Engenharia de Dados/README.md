# Data Engineering Described

## What is Data Engineering?

Data engineering has existed in some form since companies started doing things with data - such as predictive analysis, descriptive analytics, and reports - and came into sharp focus alongside the rise of data science in the 2010s.

Some definitions of data engineering:
> Data engineering is a set of operations aimed at creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information. It takes dedicates specialists - data engineers - to maintains data so that it remains available and usable by others. In short, data engineers set up and operate the organization's data infrastructure, preparing it for further analysis by dta analysts and scientists. 
– From "Data Engineering and Its Main Concepts" by AltexSoft

> The first type of data engineering is SQL-focused. The work and primary storage of the data is in relational databases. All of the data processing is done with SQL or a SQL-based language. Sometimes, this data processing is done with an ETL tool. The second type of data engineering is Big Data-focused. The work and primary storage of the data is in Big Data technologies, like Hadoop, Cassandra, and HBase. All of the data processing is done with Big Data frameworks like MapReduce, Spark, and Flink. While SQL is used, the primary processing is done with programming languages like Java, Scala, and Python.

> Data engineering is all about the movement, manipulation, and management of data.

## Data engineering defined

A data engineer gets data, stores it, and prepares it for consumption by data scientists, analysts, and others.

> Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.

## The Data Engineering Lifecycle

The stages of the data engineering lifecyce are as follows:
- Generation; 
- Storage;
- Ingestion;
- Transformation;
- Serving.

The data engineering lifecycle also has a notion of undercurrents - critical ideas across the entire lifecycle. These include security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.
